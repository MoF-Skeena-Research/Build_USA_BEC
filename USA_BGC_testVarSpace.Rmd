# Script to test the training point set variable space against full variable space. Check of extrapolation errors in building USA_BGC
1. Import training point data
2. create raster surface data set or downlaod from climateWNA

```{r import training data}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
